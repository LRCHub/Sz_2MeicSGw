Visions conjure throughout
A delusion searing into memory
So vividly

Once compulsively wrought
Now imbued to confine a once-great mind
Forever

Paradigm abstraction
Contortion absolute

Reduction of wisdom into basest impulse
The faintest glimpse of the reflections remain

The visage presenting itself as a wretched beast
A gruesome debasement of vigilance released

Corpulent sycophant
Forcibly satiate

Parasitе omnivore
Ravaging nesciencе

Bastardized abomination reveling in self-destruction
Restructured horrendously through eons of suffering

Bastardized abomination reveling in self-destruction
Self-flagellation, infinite thought regression

Reason crumbles throughout
An illusion permeating identity
Completely

Once impulsively mocked
Now rejoicing in the deadened halls of lucidity
Heedlessly

Ambitions recanted
Degeneration complete

Reduction of wisdom into basest impulse
The faintest glimpse of the reflections remain

The visage presenting itself as a wretched beast
A gruesome debasement of vigilance released

Corpulent sycophant
Forcibly satiate

Parasite omnivore
Ravaging nescience

Bastardized abomination reveling in self-destruction
Restructured horrendously through eons of suffering

Bastardized abomination reveling in self-destruction
Self-flagellation, infinite thought regression

Infinite

Thought

Infinite

Regression

So tranquil...
So tranquil...
So tranquil...
Has my erasure become

Blissfully I depart
And separate from my mind
Blissfully I depart
And soon I will forget
